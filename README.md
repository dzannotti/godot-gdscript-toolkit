# GDScript Toolkit

This project is a fork of the original excellent (gd-toolkit) [https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit]

However i was frustrated with the amount of time it'd take to format and lint files
(often several seconds) so i tasked Roo Code to port the original repo (excluding gd2py and gdradon) to Go

This repo is fully AI generated code

## Installation
